# Kata Kickstarts - Vue (September 11, 2023)
​
This is a small Vue project scaled-down from the capstone starter code. This document walks you through how to set up and run the project. It also explains the project's features, such as Vue Router, Vuex, and authentication.
​
## Project setup
​
The first thing you'll need to do is to download any dependencies by running this command:
​
```
npm install
```

# .NET
VUE_APP_REMOTE_API=https://localhost:44358

# Java
VUE_APP_REMOTE_API=http://localhost:9000
```

Your Vue frontend communicates with this API endpoint to authenticate and register users.

Before moving on, you'll need to modify the `.env` file. If you're a Java student, remove the .NET API endpoint from the `.env` file. If you're a .NET student, remove the Java API endpoint from the `.env` file. Make sure the URL is correct, and then save the file.

Start your Vue application with the following command:
​
```
npm run serve
```

### Authentication

Authentication code has been removed from this repository for this particular set of exercises.
​
### Vuex
​
Vuex acts as a centralized data store.
​

### Vue Router

The Vue Router allows you to setup routes to different views in your application and to API endpoints.
